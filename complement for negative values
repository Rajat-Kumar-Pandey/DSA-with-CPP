### 1. **Represent 3 and -6 in 4 bits**  
In 4 bits, numbers are represented using **2's complement** for negative values:  

- **3 in binary (4 bits)**:  
  Convert 3 to binary: `0011`.

- **-6 in binary (4 bits)**:  
  1. Write 6 in binary: `0110`.  
  2. Take the 1's complement (invert bits): `1001`.  
  3. Add 1 to the 1's complement: `1010`.  
  So, `-6` in 4 bits: `1010`.

### 2. **Represent 13 and -16 in 5 bits**  
In 5 bits, numbers are represented using **2's complement**:  

- **13 in binary (5 bits)**:  
  Convert 13 to binary: `01101`.

- **-16 in binary (5 bits)**:  
  1. Write 16 in binary: `10000`.  
  2. Take the 1's complement: `01111`.  
  3. Add 1 to the 1's complement: `10000`.  
  So, `-16` in 5 bits: `10000`.
